# Delayed Rejection Generalized Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (DRGHMC) Sampler

## Work In Progress :construction:

Experiments with DRGHMC, a novel sampler that excells at high-curvature densities. Preliminary results are promising but more experiments are needed.

This is my work done at the Flatiron Institue with [Chirag Modi](https://modichirag.github.io/), [Edward Roualdes](https://roualdes.us/), and [Bob Carpenter](https://bob-carpenter.github.io/). This repository is forked from the [Bayes-Kit](https://github.com/flatironinstitute/bayes-kit) repository, where I implemented DRGHMC.
