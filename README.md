This repository contains code for experiments, manuscript, and poster of [Sampling From multiscale densities with delayed rejection generalized Hamiltonian Monte Carlo](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02741), submitted to NeurIPS 2024.

## Overview :telescope:

We propose the delayed rejection generalized Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (DR-G-HMC) algorithm to simultaneously solve two problems in Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling for Bayesian inference:

- **Multiscale densities**: DR-G-HMC can sample from hierarchical models that exhibit varying curvature (ie multiscale) with dynamic step size selection, enabled by making multiple proposal attempts with decreasing step sizes in a single sampling iteration.
- **Inefficient G-HMC**: DR-G-HMC replaces rejections with additional proposal attempts, thereby avoiding inefficient backtracking that plagues the generalized HMC (G-HMC) algorithm.

Extensive emperical experiments demonstrate that DR-G-HMC can indeed (1) sample from multiscale densities (unlike NUTS!) and (2) resolve the inefficiencies of G-HMC while (3) maintaining competitiveness with state of the art samplers on non-multiscale densities.

## Usage :computer:

To **use DR-G-HMC for your own hierarchical model** with multiscale geometry, use the [Bayes-Kit](https://github.com/flatironinstitute/bayes-kit/blob/main/bayes_kit/drghmc.py) implementation.

Bayes-Kit is a readable, well documented repository for Bayesian inference algorithms in Python. Consider starring the repository :star: along with others ![Bayes-Kit](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/flatironinstitute/bayes-kit?style=social) !
